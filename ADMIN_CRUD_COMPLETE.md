### Data Flow

```
User Action (Frontend)
    ↓
API Call (axios)
    ↓
Backend Controller
    ↓
Service Layer
    ↓
Database (MySQL)
    ↓
Response Back to Frontend
    ↓
Auto-refresh Data
    ↓
Updated UI
```

## 🔄 Auto-Refresh Mechanism

Every page has automatic refresh after operations:
- After adding new record → `fetchData()` called
- After updating record → `fetchData()` called
- After deleting record → `fetchData()` called

This ensures the frontend always shows the latest data from the database.

## 🔐 Security

- All endpoints are protected with JWT authentication
- Admin/Warden role checks in place
- Students can only view their own data
- CORS configured for localhost:3000
